# Capstone Project Modul 1

Please read this before you proceed to run the application

This Python project was created to fulfill the Capstone Project Module 1, which involves the implementation of fundamental Python learning from the Digital Science course by Purwadhika Digital School. This application was created to apply the functions of CRUD Data. The data used is dummy data that is not connected to a database. This application is purely a programming exercise aimed at understanding the fundamental usage of Python.
